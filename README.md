Algorithm Visualizer:
This project is an interactive visualization tool developed to understand the working principles and complexities ($O$ Notation) of basic sorting algorithms.
It was created using Python and Streamlit libraries. 
 About the Project:
 It aims to visualize not only the theoretical speeds of algorithms but also their Comparison and Swap costs, thus making the mechanical differences between them tangible.
